with ng serve --open (--opem will open the page in the browser)\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nDocumentation\nWe use Compodoc (https://compodoc.app/) to create our documentation.\nTo create the documentation in the projects root folder run\nnpm run compodoc\nTo serve the documentation in the projects root folder run\ncompodoc -s\nand point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nSass and CSS\nThe files src/assets/css/s4g-theme.min.css and src/assets/css/styles.min.css are generated. Please, do not mess with them :)\nsrc/assets/css/s4g-theme.min.css contains the S4G color theme used by Angular Material. In order to change something here, adjust sass/s4g-theme.scss and compile running gulp material-theme\nAll styles compiled under src/assets/css/styles.min.css can be found in the respective partials in the sass folder. To compile these just run gulp, this will also start a watch task that will monitor any further changes.\nNaming convention\nFor CSS class names we use the BEM naming convention
